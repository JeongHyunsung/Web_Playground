## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS, JS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused on making the project similar to the design and making it look good on devices of various sizes. I learned that in order to do responsive web design efficiently, I need to start with an accurate understanding of design and layout.

### Continued development

Next time, I want to study web design using frameworks such as react.
