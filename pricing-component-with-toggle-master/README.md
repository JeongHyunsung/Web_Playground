## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript

### What I learned

1. I practiced the basics of layout using HTML and CSS, and knew how to  change the content of a document using toggle switch.

2. I found that Flex and Grid are useful tools for creating attractive layouts, and I need to practice using and applying them more in the future.

### Continued development

Since this webpage is relatively static, so I want to create more dynamic, complex webpage and develop proficiency in using CSS properties and javascript.
